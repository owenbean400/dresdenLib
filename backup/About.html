        Academy Public Library&nbsp;</b></font></p>
              <p align="justify"><i><font face="Times New Roman" size="4">Many thanks to <b>
              Doris Souviney</b> for compiling the following history of Bridge
              Academy for us.</font></i></p>
              <p align="justify"><font face="Times New Roman" size="4">At one time there
              were 10 school districts [in Dresden,] each with its own one-room
              building. Students, especially the boys, attended when they were
              not needed on the farm.</font></p>
              <p align="justify"><font face="Times New Roman" size="4">It was not until
              the latter part of the 1800's that some type of higher education
              was available. By 1890 Bridge Academy was established, by private
              endowment, providing the type of education that enabled young
              adults to go out into the world in other than the labor field.</font></p>
              <p align="justify"><font face="Times New Roman" size="4">Bridge Academy
              came into existence due to the generosity of Llewellyn Lithgow and
              Samuel Bridge. Later, additional endowments from Edmund and
              Frederick Bridge enhanced the potential for &quot;A Free High School
              for the children of Dresden&quot;. It served in that capacity for the
              youth of Dresden, and other 'tuition' students from many areas
              until 1966. There were over 430 students who earned their high
              school diplomas between 1892 and 1966. As the high school
              enrollment decreased, the Trustees voted to let the seventh and
              eighth grades use a room from 1946 until 1983 when the town voted
              to send all seventh and eighth grade students to Wiscasset High
              School.</font></p>
              <p align="justify"><font face="Times New Roman" size="4">In 1966 due to
              requirements under new State laws regarding the fact that some tax
              money had been involved, and which included added courses and more
              space, which the B.A. income could not provide, the building could
              no longer serve as a high school. The Trustees allowed the Town to
              continue using the building as a Junior High.</font></p>
              <p align="justify"><font face="Times New Roman" size="4">In 1891 an act of
              the Legislature was approved incorporating Bridge Academy for the
              'promotion of education, literature and science'. Therefore in
              1984, Trustees of Bridge Academy set up a Public Library to serve
              the young people of the town and all other residents. Adult
              educational courses have been offered. Donations are made to the
              Kenyon Memorial Art Fund and to the Dresden Elementary School for
              special programs that the taxpayers' money does not provide.
              Scholarships are awarded to Dresden college students who meet
              certain requirements.</font></p>
              <p align="justify"><font face="Times New Roman" size="4">Bridge Academy
              provides the finances for, and prepares the informational DRESDEN
              COMMUNICATOR, which is mailed monthly to every resident of Dresden
              and some local newspapers. This paper reports, free of charge,
              information only on civic group meetings. The building is also
              used as a meeting place for many civic groups such as The Planning
              Board, Internet Group, The Conservation Commission, and the
              Dresden Historical Society, also some special meetings such as the
              Brownies, Scouts and others.</font></p>
              <p align="justify"><font face="Times New Roman" size="4">For anyone
              interested in the detailed, and at times, the emotionally
              involved, issues before the actual construction of the building,
              you may refer to Charles Edwin Allen's HISTORY of DRESDEN. The
              site chosen was near the center of the Dresden Mills section of
              the Town of Dresden and the architect from Boston was George A.
              Clough. The builder, Roscoe M. Beedle was from Dresden.</font></p>
              <p align="justify"><font face="Times New Roman" size="4">The basement
              included space for furnace, an exercise room and two rest rooms,
              and at one time a bowling alley. The grounds provided a baseball
              field, tennis and basketball courts. Dedicatory exercises were
              held on December 1, 1890 and the school officially opened December
              8, 1890.</font></p>
              <p align="justify"><font face="Times New Roman" size="4">This impressive
              building was of a unique design including the roof's gables and
              30-foot spire, very tall windows in the large main room with a
              high ceiling of embossed tin. The main room was the 'home-room'
              for up to 80 students. The other classrooms were a large
              recitation room and chemistry lab on the north side, and on the
              south side were a classroom and a spacious library also used as
              the typing room. The staff included a principal and two teachers,
              all of whom taught the many subjects using all the rooms described
              above. The first principal was George C. Sheldon and his
              assistants were &quot;The Misses Maud Barker and Nellie Sheldon&quot;.</font></p>
              <p align="justify"><font face="Times New Roman" size="4">On May 16, 1891
              the first graduation class held its exercises in the Methodist
              Church, which is still in existence in Dresden Village. College
              Preparatory, Lithgow Commercial, Scientific and General Courses
              required many subjects: English, French, Latin, Plane and Solid
              Geometry, Algebra, Trigonometry, Biology, Chemistry, Ancient
              American and Medieval History, Typing, Shorthand, Spelling, Jr.
              Business Training, Guidance, Commercial Law, Business Math and
              Commercial Geography.</font></p>
              <p align="justify"><font face="Times New Roman" size="4">Extra curricular
              activities varied from time to time but Prize Speaking Contests
              and Play Productions were popular while Winter Carnivals added to
              the other season's outdoor sports.</font></p>
