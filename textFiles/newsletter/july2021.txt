<b>New Book by local author:</b>  After many years of exhaustive research, Dresden resident Lewis Putnam Turco has published Satan’s Scourge: a Narrative of the Age of Witchcraft in England and New England 1580-1697.  Lewis is descended on his mother’s side from the Putnam family of Salem Village, Massachusetts, a family that figured prominently in the New England witch hunt of the late 1600s, and his volume gives the reader some fascinating insight into a turbulent time in our history.
