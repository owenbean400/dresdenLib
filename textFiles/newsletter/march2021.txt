From the developer -- Currently, newsletter page will take a while to start 
filling up with information. At the moment I've been redesigning and coding
the Bridge Academy Public Library webpage. My main goal is to get the website
up and running with the information needed for people. I want to make sure
that the information layout is easy to nagivate. Afterwards, I will be working
on accessiblility and making the events calendar work. I also want to make
the library catalog look nice, add some new books displayed on the website,
and form page for book suggestions. If there any questions or feedback on the
webpage, please feel free to contact the library. Contact information to the
library is at the bottom of the page in the footer
